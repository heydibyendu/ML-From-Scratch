# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch** repository! This project is dedicated to implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms without relying on pre-built libraries. Each algorithm is crafted to showcase the underlying principles and coding techniques necessary for understanding and building these models from the ground up.

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find essential machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python. Each implementation includes clear code, inline comments, and a breakdown of the algorithmic logic to help data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and students strengthen their grasp on the core concepts behind each method.

## Algorithms Implemented
### Classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, yet powerful algorithm that classifies data points based on their nearest neighbors.

## Upcoming Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- FNN

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Required libraries (like NumPy) for numerical computations

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
